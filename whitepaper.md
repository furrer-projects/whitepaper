# Inflation, Deflation and Monetary
The most important part of managing a currency is managing Inflation and Deflation. in fiat currencies, central banks manage the inflation and deflation using interest rates, it is very useful tools. in crypto currencies there are serverl methods to manage the inflation/deflation: staking, reducing issue, burning coins ...
- staking: earn interest by locking your equities in a deligate, some networks have internal network staking mechanism. also there are many 3th-party staking funds.

- reducing issue : some currencies like bitcoin uses a mechanism like mining rewards. they issue coins as mining reward and in specific periods they reduce the rewards and make a (logarithmic) inflation in the value of the currency. 

- burning coins : burining extra coins also is a mechanism to make inflation in a currency. some networks have a none-recyclable address and send some coins/tokens to the burning address and exclude some coins from the econimic cycles.

Alper Network has a Protocol with a dynamic issue/burning mechanism. there is a inflation token issued in 1,000,000 tokens it called decision token. there is a yearly %1 issue in the tokens and every month the decision token  owners can increase/decrease the issuance of the token by 0.1%. maximum issuance percent is 2% yearly and minimum issuancee percent is 0.5%. the starting of issuance of new tokens are 0.5% per year.

Who receives the issued yearly tokens?
34% of issued tokens will shared all token owners as interest rate, 33% of issued token will spend to (available) nodes and 33% of issued tokens will pay to the reserve of the fundation to hold / sell or burn to make the currency manual managable too. fundation reserve account won't receive interest rates. all issued tokens and will pay every month.
